Old version back-end code mainly done by Tianyu is deprecated and moved here in this directory.

For guys who want to run this part of code, source MySQL script under `./database_old` as your local
database and run `python3 main.py`.

But still I don't suggest you to do that, since the front-end has changed along with the back-end,
which means this part of code is someway really obsolete.
