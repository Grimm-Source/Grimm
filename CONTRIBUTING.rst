=======================
Contributing to Grimm
=======================
As an open source project which aims at helping the visually-impaired people, a nice and warm community is surely fundamental. 
Therefore, Grimm welcomes contributions from everyone who's interested and willing to deliver efforts.

However, any contribution needs to follow subsequent forms, this is to help building the community itself.

-----
Fork
-----
Fork is always a recommended way to contribute your work, since this is the way which brings least chance of breaking this repo.
Following this method, fork this repo first, and make proper changes and then raise a pull-request, we will review your changes and
merge them into master if it helps.

----------
Branches
----------
Branch ``dev`` is always open to internal developers, both front-end developers and back-end developers. To keep branch ``master``
clean, we limited its access to all involved. If you are working on a new feature or fixing some existent bugs, first make commits 
to the branch ``dev``, and after going through reveiwing and testing, we will merge those commits onto ``master``.

-------
Master
-------
As the main branch, branch ``master`` is only open to some developers with ``Admin`` permission of this repo. Developer who's granted
as ``Admin`` has responsibilities to maintain this repo well. In other word, make commits when you have to, and assure everything is 
trackable. From my perspective, this branch is only necessarily used when commiting ``repo files`` changes, such as ``gitignore``, 
``CODE-OF-CONDUCT``, etc.



**Thanks for all contributions, people who benifits from Grimm will surely feel grateful to all you guys.**
